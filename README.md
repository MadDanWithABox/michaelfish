## Introduction ðŸŒ»

> **Michael Fish** This project is a weather prediction app, based on a fork of [**Katana**](https://github.com/shaz13/katana) a template for ASAP ðŸš€ ML application deployment.


> **Why MichaelFish?** [Michael Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fish) is a famous ritish weather forecaster, who notably failed to predict a major tornado in a well-publicised TV [gaffe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnxjZ-aFkjs). This project is also not built with a focus on accuracy of prediction, but rather as an illustration of a breadth-first ML deployment.

### Features ðŸŽ‰
1. Standard weather prediction based on date
2. Advanced weather prediction based on satellite-based information
3. Model evaluation results


## Set-up Instructions ðŸ”§
I have built this applet with a strong preference for Docker-based development and deployment. Non-docker-based deployment strategies from the original katana project may not be supported, and have not been maintained/updated

### Docker Setup â›´
1. Clone this repo with `git@github.com/MadDanWithABox/michaelfish.git`
2. Install docker in your system
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Your local port is mapped and being served at `localhost:8000`
